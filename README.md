# Account Lockout — Flarum Extension

Protect your [Flarum](https://flarum.org) forum against brute-force login attacks by automatically locking accounts after too many failed login attempts.

## Features

- **Configurable Attempt Threshold** — Set the maximum number of failed login attempts before an account is locked (default: 5)
- **Timed Lockout** — Accounts auto-unlock after a configurable duration (5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes)
- **Manual Lockout** — Require an admin or moderator to manually unlock accounts
- **Password Reset Unlock** — Timed lockouts are automatically cleared when a user resets their password
- **Admin Bypass** — Admin accounts are never locked out
- **Unlock Controls** — Moderators and admins can unlock accounts from user profiles and the admin users page
- **Locked Badge** — Locked users display a badge visible to moderators and admins
- **Login Error Messages** — Custom error messages inform users when their account is locked and when they can try again
